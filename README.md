> 📖 A personal learning repository containing code examples and notes from studying "Command-Line Rust" by Kennet Youens-Clark and Luciano Mammino.

This repository serves as my personal learning journal while studying the Command-Line Rust book. It contains implemented examples, notes, and practical exercises that help reinforce the concepts presented in the book. This is **not** a reproduction of the book's content but rather a collection of personal learning materials and implementations.
